# Tire Modeling Using FSAE TTC
Data used in this program is from Formula SAE Tire Test Consortium (FSAE TTC) and Calspan Tire Research Facility (TIRF)
# Set Up:
Make sure you have the correct Python libraries installed using the requirements.txt
Have the .mat uscs tire data files from the FSAE TTC and Calspan and know what files you need 
The GUI will open when you run the script and you use the button to make file choices and the text boxes to make a camber, pressure, and File name.
The output file will make .pngs of each of the graphs and an excel file with curve fit data and the graph photos.
The .pngs saved into your output folder will be overwritten unless you change the output folder every time.
